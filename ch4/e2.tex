    Pad 0 to the original matrix and the submatrices so that the dimension of
    the padded matrix is exact power of 2. It can be proved that: \\
    If $A\cdot B = C$, then:
    \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{pmatrix} A & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \cdot
        \begin{pmatrix} B & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} =
        \begin{pmatrix} C & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{displaymath}
    So that we can compose a $n \times n$ matrix at each recursion with $n =
    2^k$, then strip off the 0s to get the result. Since the padding process
    is $O(n^2)$, this lower order term does not affect the total running time,
    which is $O(n^{\lg 7})$.
\subsection{4.2-4}
    Being able to multiply $3 \times 3$ matries using $k$ multiplication gives
    the recurrence $T(n) = kT(n/3) + \Theta(n^2)$. According to the master
    theorem, since $n^{\log_3^{k-e}} > n^{\log_3^9}$, the solution to this
    recurrence is $\Theta(n^{log_3^k})$.  To make it $o(n^{\lg 7})$, then
    $\log_3^k < \lg 7$, so the largest $k$ is 21. The running time of this
    algorithm is $\Theta(n^{log_3^21})$.
