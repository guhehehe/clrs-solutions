\subsection{11.1-1}
    Assume that the dynamic set is represented by direct-address table $T$, we
    can iterate through $T$, and store the maxmium value in a variable.  Since
    searching operation of direct-address table is $O(1)$, it takes $O(m)$ to
    find the maxmium element.
\subsection{11.1-2}
    Set the $i^{th}$ bit of the vector to 1 if the $i^{th}$ element is inserted
    and 0 if it is deleted.
\subsection{11.1-3}
    Use the basic structure of the traditional direct-address table, but each
    element should have 2 fields: satellite data and a pointer to the next
    element, so that elements with identical key value could be stored in a
    linked list.
